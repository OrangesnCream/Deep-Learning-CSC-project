Homework 2: This is a coding assignment, similar to the work presented in class. You will measure the speedup of matrix-matrix multiplication in vectorized form vs. plain python. In class we did vector-vector and vector-matrix multiplication speedups; you will extend that work to matrix-matrix multiplication.
